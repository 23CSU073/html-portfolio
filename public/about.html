<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Bhavya, a second-year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student driven by a passion for technology and problem-solving. My journey into the tech world began with a fascination for how digital solutions simplify our lives. This curiosity led me to explore various programming languages, with Java being my initial step into software development. Having completed a Java course from Coding Ninjas, I gained foundational knowledge that has fueled my interest in Full-Stack Development. Currently, I am deepening my skills through a comprehensive Web Development course on Udemy, focusing on creating dynamic, user-friendly applications. With a specialization in Full-Stack Development, I am committed to mastering both front-end design and back-end logic to build impactful digital products. My adaptability and love for learning help me tackle new challenges with confidence, whether it’s debugging code, designing intuitive interfaces, or exploring new technologies like Salesforce to strengthen my professional expertise.</p>

<p>Beyond the world of technology, I am a passionate baker who runs a home-based bakery specializing in homemade cakes and cookies. Baking started as a hobby, but it quickly grew into a venture where I could combine creativity with entrepreneurship. Each cake and cookie I make is crafted with care, focusing on quality ingredients and attention to detail to deliver something truly special. This entrepreneurial journey has taught me valuable lessons in customer satisfaction, time management, and perseverance—skills that have enriched both my personal and professional life. Despite having a small customer base, the joy of spreading happiness through my baked creations motivates me to continually improve and innovate. Balancing this venture with my academic pursuits has shown me how to navigate multiple responsibilities while staying true to my passions.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I aspire to create a meaningful impact by blending my technical expertise with my entrepreneurial mindset. My ultimate goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer who can craft innovative solutions to real-world problems while also growing my bakery into a larger venture. The intersection of creativity and logic excites me, whether it’s designing a seamless user experience for a web application or experimenting with new baking techniques. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning and adaptability, values that guide me in every endeavor. As an introvert, I find strength in thoughtful actions and meaningful connections, which help me stay focused and driven. Whether collaborating on a challenging tech project or designing a cake for someone’s special day, I bring dedication, creativity, and a genuine desire to make a difference. Let’s connect to explore new ideas, create together, or simply share a love for technology and baking!</p>
